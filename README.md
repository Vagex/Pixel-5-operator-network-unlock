# 存储库封闭
* 由于我发现已经有比我做得更好的模块出现
* 这使得我维护变得毫无意义
* 而且我也不想冒着数据丢失的风险来制作模块(我只有一个Pixel 5，它是我主要使用的手机)
* 除非我有创新发现，否则该库永久关闭
* 因此关闭
****
# Repository closed
* Since I found that there are already modules that have done better than me
* This makes my maintenance meaningless
* And I don’t want to risk data loss to make a module (I only have a Pixel 5, which is the phone I’m using)
* Unless I have a new discovery, the Repository is permanently closed
* So closed.
